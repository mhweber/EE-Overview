	Just for back story, Google has been doing Earth Engine summits for about 8 years now I think, as well as Geo for Good summits - this year for 
	first time they combined the two - about 800 people from all over the world at Google headquarters
	I'd applied previously and been rejected, and was rejected again, but this year they opened up 2 slots from the EPA, and just 3 EPA employees had applied -
	Mike, Nate Merrill who's on the line, and myself.  Mike was gracious enough to give his spot to me, so next year Mike should definitely go

 Slide 3
	My plan is to give a bit of background on Earth Engine, then give a brief overview of Earth Engine functionality, move into some actual code examples of how
	to use Earth Engine, and then show some example simple applications - Nate is going to give an overview of some full fledged applications he's developed after
	that.  If we have time, can have discussion or anyone else is free to talk about work they're doing with EE.  Feel free to ask questions as we go.

Slide 4
	Researchers working with remote sensing traditionally have had to spend a huge amount of time on 'IT' work in comparison with actual analysis
	One of the biggest motivations and benefits of Earth Engine is providing a mechanism to vastly improve this ratio so that more time is spent on analysis
	and not sweating the details of downloading data, coordinating file formats, cloud and atmospheric correction, etc
	
Slide 5
	Earth Engine operates on the premise of what I would say is a bit of a paradigm shift - rather than worrying about downloading data, move the analysis to the data
	Earth Engine is hosting massive troves of remote sensing data in their catalog and it allows you to process against this catalog of data by distributing your analysis
	across CPUs server side

	2 ways to import Landsat 8 Tier 1 Surface Reflectance:
		1) Type 'Landsat 8 Tier 1' into Search bar and import - just the collection
		2) Import from Data Catalog but update to Corvallis -123, 44.5 map.setCenter
