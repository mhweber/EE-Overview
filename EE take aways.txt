Take-aways from EE Summit:

- Geo for Good / EE Summit has been going I think for about 8 years now, first time combining the two into one event
- Lots of concurrent sessions; I followed kind of a deep dive into nuts and bolts of using Earth Engine
- Sessions on Mapping and Collections, Reducers, Import Export, the Python API, basic EE data structures, building EE Apps
- Conference was Geo for Good so many keynotes, sessions, lightning talks not just on EE but on other Google Geo products and applications
- Some of the new interesting stuff was BigQuery GIS and the relearse of the TensorFlow object in EE, as well as the new Early Access Rest API - 
	have to request to be whitelisted to use, but allows you to do EE computation and use the EE catalog from any language via an HTTP API
