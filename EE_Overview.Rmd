## What Is Earth Engine?

Groelick et al. (2017) in ['Google Earth Engine: Planetory-scale geospatial analysis for everyone' in *Remote Sensing of the Environment*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425717302900):

> "Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based platform for planetary-scale geospatial analysis that brings Googleâ€™s massive computational capabilities to bear on a variety of high-impact societal issues including deforestation, drought, disaster, disease, food security, water management, climate monitoring and environmental protection."

## Why Use Earth Engine?

- Petabytes and petabytes of Earth observation data being collected
- Planetary Science: global-scale problems requiring analysis of increasingly larger and more complex geospatial data
 - A number of ground-breaking studies and papers have come out in recent years leveraging the power of large-scale computing in GEE on environmental and social problems

   + [Example EE script for visualizing the data](https://code.earthengine.google.com/d52c656d3098b2723b275cc0d113d05e)
   
## Why Use Earth Engine?

- Cloud-based, parallelized geospatial analysis (server-side analysis)
- Google Earth Engine takes care of the infrastructure and paralellization implementation - traditionally a big big bottleneck!
- Apply a huge number of functions developed for computaiton in Earth Engine and apply to massive amount of images simultaneously using GEE infrastructure
   + No need to download / analyze individual tiles and deal with local storage issues
- **Massive** Public Data Catalog (29 petabytes) - largest analysis-ready dataset in the world
   + ~ 1 Petabyte/month being added
   + Over 6000 datasets
   + ~ 100 datasets / year added
   + You can request data, and you can upload your own data!
   
## How does it work?

- Using browser-based code editor, write commands that are sent as object to Google for processing in parallel in the cloud (server-side)
- You visualize results (maps, charts, statistics) from Google in the browser (client-side)
- Using API:
   + Filter massive collections of images to certain times or areas-of-interest (AOI)
   + Map algorithms over entire collections of images or features
   + Apply algorithms to individual images or features
   + Compute aggregate statistics through time / space without any download to your machine

## Earth Engine Fundamentals 

"Earth Engine is not like any GIS you have ever used before! ... it is incredibly powerful. It is also strange and wondrous."  - [EE Developers Overview page](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/concepts_overview)

- EE is a cloud-based platform for planetary-scale environmnetal data analysis, composed of:
   * Datasets, Google Computational Infrastructure, APIs, and a Code Editor (see [developers.google.com/earth-engine](developers.google.com/earth-engine))
- Images in Earth Engine stored at native resolution in native projection
- EE projects to Mercator when you dispaly images in code editor, and uses nearest neighbor sampling by default

## Earth Engine Fundamentals 
You'll need to sign up for an [Earth Engine account](http://signup.earthengine.google.com) to use the tools

## Earth Engine Fundamentals
Earth Engine Objects:

- Images 
- Features
- Collections

## Earth Engine Fundamentals

<div class='left' style='float:left;width:48%'>

- Images have:

   * Bands: grid of pixels that have:
      + Name
      + CRS / Projection
      + Scale
   * Properties, at a minimum:
      + Date
      + Bounding box
      + Unique ID
 
   * [Code Editor Sample](https://code.earthengine.google.com/83880155a74987232b52a4ff587bf10b)

   knitr::include_graphics('./Bands.png')
```
</div>


## Earth Engine Fundamentals

<div class='left' style='float:left;width:48%'>

- Features have:

   * Geometry (Point, Line, Polygon)
   * Properties (Same as images)
   * Features have geomtry property and a 'properties' property
      + 'properties' property just a dictionary for each feature
   * [Code Editor Sample](https://code.earthengine.google.com/d98c4f16ddcc390c788efa06dcad8983)

```
</div>

## Earth Engine Fundamentals

Collections

- Collections are typically what you encounter in the wild in EE
- They are unmodifiable, homogenous lists
- Both features and  images come as FeatureCollections or ImageCollections
- Take a minute to scroll through the [EE Data Catalog](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets)
   + You'll notice most datasets you check are image or feature collections

## Earth Engine Programming
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="1200px"}
   knitr::include_graphics('./Agenda3.png')
```

## Earth Engine Programming
What do we do with collections?

- Filtering
   + Select images / features meeting criteria
- Mapping
   + Apply a function to every image / feature in collection
- Reducing
   + Aggregate / Composite images and features 
      * i.e. mean / max of images, sum / mean of feature column
- Compositing and Mosaicking
   + Compositing: Combine spatially overlapping images into single band using an aggregate function (a reduction)
   + Mosaicking: Combining non-overlapping images into a spatially continuous image
- Control flows a no-no in EE
   + No for loops, conditionals -

## Earth Engine Programming
Important take-homes for programming in EE:

- Earth Engine uses defered execution (lazy evaluation)
   + Results only derived when and where needed
      * i.e. in map window for display; as result of print statement
- Batch Processing
   + Operations in the code editor time out after 1 minute - that's all you get
   + Operations submitted in batch you get up to 1 week of processing time!
      * You set up a batch process by setting up an export task in your code
   + [Example Region Reduction and export of results](https://code.earthengine.google.com/782cd752d90155ca11b661f4b4cbbf77)
     
## Next Steps in EE Programming

Treasure trove of documentation and examples in the [Developer's Guide](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/getstarted):

- Machine Learning Approaches
   * Developing TensorFlow models in EE
   * Supervised and Unsupervised classifications
- Image Processing
   * Spectral Transformations
   * Edge Detection
   * Morphological Operations (i.e. focal_min, focal_max)
- More on Reducers (weighted reductions, linear regression, etc)
- Joins
- Charting
- Array operations

## Earth Engine Apps

- EE Apps are way to share an analysis or workflow and simple way to publish work
- [Example EE Apps](https://www.earthengine.app/)
- We *build* apps in the code editor and add *User Interface (UI)* widgets
   * Widgets:
      + Let users input parameters or interact with your script
      + Display information (labels, charts, thumbnails)
- Example 1: [Zoom Box of Night Light Trends](https://mweber36.users.earthengine.app/view/zoombox)
- Example 2: [NDVI Explorer](https://mweber36.users.earthengine.app/view/ndvi-explorer)

## New Developments
